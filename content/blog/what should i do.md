Already, half of the year is over. I currently am waiting for my college to start, who knows what is going to come. Life has been very smooth selling so far. I feel like my responsibility have started to increase a lot. No more am I just a boy. **I am official, an adult.** Yes, I can if I want, make *babies* lol. Currently, my goal is to get an internship and *earn some money*, as to make my self proud and fell confident. Life has become both hard and more enjoyable. Asking money from dad fells like **crime** **(not really but i want to make my self fell this way).**
