So for a long time I have been trying to make a decently functional website, but it failed. Sometime due to wrong layout, sometimes due to too poor font and color choice, But this time I fell like I have made a good come back.

I have always wanted to create a *blogging website* which people will actually read, And in the process I have realized that making a website is **easy**, but getting the content that people will actually read is very hard. Nowadays, my respect for newsletter writers have immensely increased. That regularly provide good content even single week.

Now coming back to how I created this website, I use [ZOLA](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/), it's a static website generator. Along with normal HTML and CSS. [Color palette](https://colorhunt.co/palette/2c061f374045d89216e1d89f) from colorhunt.io
