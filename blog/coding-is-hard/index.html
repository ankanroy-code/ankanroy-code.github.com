    <p>So for a long time I have been trying to make a decently functional website, but it failed. Sometime due to wrong layout, sometimes due to too poor font and color choice, But this time I fell like I have made a good come back.</p>
<p>I have always wanted to create a <em>blogging website</em> which people will actually read, And in the process I have realized that making a website is <strong>easy</strong>, but getting the content that people will actually read is very hard. Nowadays, my respect for newsletter writers have immensely increased. That regularly provide good content even single week.</p>
<p>Now coming back to how I created this website, I use <a href="https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/">ZOLA</a>, it's a static website generator. Along with normal HTML and CSS. <a href="https://colorhunt.co/palette/2c061f374045d89216e1d89f">Color palette</a> from colorhunt.io</p>
