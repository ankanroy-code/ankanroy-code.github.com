    <p>Already, half of the year is over. I currently am waiting for my college to start, who knows what is going to come. Life has been very smooth selling so far. I feel like my responsibility have started to increase a lot. No more am I just a boy. <strong>I am official, an adult.</strong> Yes, I can if I want, make <em>babies</em> lol. Currently, my goal is to get an internship and <em>earn some money</em>, as to make my self proud and fell confident. Life has become both hard and more enjoyable. Asking money from dad fells like <strong>crime</strong> <strong>(not really but i want to make my self fell this way).</strong></p>
