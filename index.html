                    <p>After the collapse of the tech industry, life became very hard. <b>HTML CSS JS developer</b> were found
                        on the street searching for food and job, as the number of job decreased in the <i>FANG</i>, the number
                        of people looking  jobs in startup increased, causing even more chaos. The failed developers started
                        selling their body part to survive.

                    <p><b>Now</b> are you scared. Don't be scared. Life is unpredictable, this can totally happen. So be a bit
                        <b>religious</b>, go spend time with your kids and family. Don't think too much, after all, you can't
                        avoid things that will happen. Maybe you can try creating a <b>startup</b> to help this hopeless developer
                        connect with customers.</p>
